# FEM-Project

This is an individual ABAQUS-based course Project of 'LABORATORIO PROGETTUALE DI CALCOLO STRUTTURALE (FEM)' done in 2017.7 in Politecnico di Milano, Italy.

The project is about design, analysis and verification of the 'central shaft' of a specific type of gear reducer, using the theories and software (ABAQUS) taught throughout the course.

Language: English & Italian

The file 'CAI Technical Report.pdf' sums up the whole work in English, and the files 'assembly.pdf' & 'central shaft.pdf' are the required technical drawings of the designed machine. The folder 'Modeling' mainly contains the files used for OR produced by the ABAQUS analysis process.
